Welcome! I am currently a Project Scientist in the Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, part of the University of California, San Diego.

I study air-sea boundary layer processes, as well as the dynamics of submesoscale processes.

I am interested in fluid mechanics, the dynamics of the upper ocean, surface waves, applied math and the history of science.

I perform theoretical, numerical, laboratory and field studies with the goal of understanding physical processes.
