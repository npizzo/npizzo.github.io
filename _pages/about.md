Welcome to the SURF Lab (SURFace processes Lab) at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography. We are interested in processes occuring near the surface of the ocean -- including the lower atmosphere. We apply a combinational approach and employ theory, numerics, laboratory and field techniques to better understand these phenomena. 

Our ethos is simple: we believe in collaborative work and seek to teach, train and empower the next generation of oceanographers and earth scientists.
