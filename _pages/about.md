Welcome! I am currently visitng the Department of Physics at UC Berkeley, and am a Project Scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD. In January 2024, I will begin my new role as the head of the SURF Lab (SURFace processes Lab) at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography where I will join as an Assistant Professor. We are interested in processes occuring near the surface of the ocean -- including the lower atmosphere. We apply a combination of theory, numerics, laboratory and field techniques to better understand these phenomena. 

Most importantly, we believe in open and collaborative curiousity driven science.
